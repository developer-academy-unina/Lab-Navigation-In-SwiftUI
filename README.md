## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/developer-academy-unina/Lab-Navigation-In-SwiftUI
   ```

2. Open the ```.xcodeproj``` file in the Starter project

### How to

1. Open the Starter project

2. Implement the hierarchical navigation from ```LearnerListView``` to ```LearnerDetailView```

3. Implement the flat navigation between ```LearnerListView``` and ```RedView``` in a new file named ```ContainerView```

4. In the ```LearnersApp.swift``` file (the app entry point), swap ```LearnerListView``` with ```ContainerView``` to see the flat navigation at the app launch

5. Launch the app on the simulator and check if your version is similar to the Final project
